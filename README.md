# NFL-Draft-2021

## Description
This project contains a predictive model and code to determine the relationship between variables collected from each NFL game and the number of wins for a given team in 2020. This was created to analyze the 2020 season and determine which areas need improvement as well as provide recommendations for the 2021 draft.


## Technologies
R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) was used for this project.

Libraries include:
RMySQL
DBI
Magrittr
Tidyverse
GridironaiR
GGally
Dplyr

## General Process
* Analyze a lot of NFL data from 1970-2020
* Try to figure out some relationships between full-season stats (like total yards, total rushing yards, yards per play, etc) 
* Build a linear regression to get the relationships between these variables and total wins
* Run some simulations for 2020 based on different scenarios that could have played out if those full-season stats were different (like if the Eagles had more receiving yards)
